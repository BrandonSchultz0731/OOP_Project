# OOP Project
This product was built all inside Intellij with the help of SceneBuilder and Java. Throughout the course, we have worked with
expanding our knowledge on databases, including Derby, which I have incorporated into this program. This GUI allows users to first
create an account, which gets stored into a Users table inside the Derby Database. Once logged in, users can navigate to several scenes,
one of which allows a user to enter all their courses and letter grades into a table, then calculate their GPA based on their input.
Other scenes within the project allow users to see some examples of what we have done throughout the course, like working with animations.



# Getting Started

The first step to running the program, if you haven't done so already, is to create an account. Please make sure all fields in the create account window are filled out. If not, an alert box will prompt you to do so.

Once an account has been created,
you can now click on the "Already Have an Account" button, which allows you to login with the account you just created. From their,
you will be brought to the main, logged in screen. The main part of this program is to be able to add courses to a table and calculate your GPA.

# Working With Course Scene
1) To add a course to the table, type in your course name in the designated text field. After name is entered, choose the grade you have in that class from the choicebox shown. Once both fields are entered, click the button that says "Add to Database" to show the course in the table.

2) To update a grade in the table, you first must select the course that you would like to update from the table. Once the coruse and grade are highlighted, go over to the letter grade choicebox and select which letter grade you would like to update to. Once selected, you may now click the "Update Grade" button to change the selected course grade.

3) To delete one course in the table, please select a course from the course table. Once a course is highlighted, you may click the "Delete Selected" button to remove the course from the table and the database.

4) To delete all courses from the course table, simply just click the "Delete All" button which will remove all courses and grades from the table and the database.

5) To calculate your total GPA once all courses and grades are in the table, you can click the "Calculate GPA" button. This will convert each letter grade to the associated number, add them up, and divide by the total number of courses in the table. It will display the correct average GPA, and a simple text will display more about the grade you recieved.
