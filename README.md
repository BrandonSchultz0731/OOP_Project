# OOP Project
This product was built all inside Intellij with the help of SceneBuilder and Java. Throughout the course, we have worked with
expanding our knowledge on databases, including Derby, which I have incorporated into this program. This GUI allows users to first
create an account, which gets stored into a Users table inside the Derby Database. Once logged in, users can navigate to several scenes,
one of which allows a user to enter all their courses and letter grades into a table, then calculate their GPA based on their input.
Other scenes within the project allow users to see some examples of what we have done throughout the course, like working with animations.



# Getting Started

The first step to running the program, if you haven't done so already, is to create an account. Once an account has been created,
you can now click on the "Already Have an Account" button, which allows you to login with the account you just created. From their,
you will be brought to the main, logged in screen. The main part of this program is to be able to add courses to a table and calculate your GPA.

# Working With Course Scene
1) To add a course to the table, type in your course name in the designated text field. After name is entered, choose the grade you have in that class from the choicebox shown. Once both fields are entered, click the button that says "Add to Database" to show the course in the table.

To do so, first enter a course name in the proper text box, followed your letter grade for the class in the other box. To add it to the table,
simply click the "Add to Database" button amd your course will display in the table. To remove a course, highlight the course to be removed
and click the remove button. To delete all the courses entered from the database, simply click the delete all button.
